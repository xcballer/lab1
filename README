Relevant changes appear in:
   read-command.c, 
   execute-command.c,
   command-internals.h, 
   command.h

Note that text-t-exec.sh is supposed to print "No such file or directory" 
messages to stderr.  This is part of our test cases and results in behavior 
like that of a normal shell.

Makefile was also modified to remove the -Werror tag.

We currently don't know of any specific limitations, but we certainly haven't 
exhausted testing all the corner cases and there's bound to be something 
wrong in there.

There was bit of confusion regarding the treatment of semicolon-separated 
commands as separate "complete commands" in the command stream or as 
SEQUENCE_COMMAND trees.  The decision we opted for was complete commands to 
more easily perform top-level parallelism in later parts of the project.
